/// If this property is set to YES, FLEX will swizzle NSURLConnection*Delegate and NSURLSession*Delegate methods
/// on classes that conform to the protocols. This allows you to view network activity history from the main FLEX menu.

@property (nonatomic, assign, getter=isNetworkDebuggingEnabled) BOOL networkDebuggingEnabled;

/// Defaults to 25 MB if never set. Values set here are presisted across launches of the app.
/// The response cache uses an NSCache, so it may purge prior to hitting the limit when the app is under memory pressure.

#pragma mark - Keyboard Shortcuts

/// Simulator keyboard shortcuts are enabled by default.
/// The shortcuts will not fire when there is an active text field, text view, or other responder accepting key input.

/// @param key A single character string matching a key on the keyboard
/// @param modifiers Modifier keys such as shift, command, or alt/option

/// @param description Shown the the keyboard shortcut help menu, which is accessed via the '?' key.
/// @note The action block will be retained for the duration of the application. You may want to use weak references.
/// @note FLEX registers several default keyboard shortcuts. Use the '?' key to see a list of shortcuts.
