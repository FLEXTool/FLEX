### Bug Report

Here, you can provide a description of the bug. Some tips:

- Please do not paste an entire crash log. Upload the crash log to something like [ghostbin.co](https://ghostbin.co/) or another paste service. Alternatively, you can cut out the relevant stack trace and paste that inside a ` ```code block``` `
- If the bug is more complex than "this button is broken" or a crash, consider including a sample project. For example, if your app's requests aren't showing up in the network history page.
- Providing steps to reproduce is always helpful!
- If you want to include a screenshot or GIF, consider modifying the default markdown for uploaded images to use this code to make the image smaller on desktop:
  ```
  <img width="50%" src=your-image-url >
  ```

This template is a suggestion. You may format your issue however you want, but generally you should at least include your iOS version and FLEX version.
