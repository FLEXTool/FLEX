# FLEX
FLEX (Flipboard Explorer) is a set of in-app debugging and exploration tools for iOS development. When presented, FLEX shows a toolbar that lives in a window above your application. From this toolbar, you can view and modify nearly every piece of state in your running application.

## Give Yourself Debugging Superpowers
- Inspect and modify views in the hierarchy.
- See the properties and ivars on any object.
- Dynamically modify many properties and ivars.
- Dynamically call instance and class methods.
- Access any live object via a scan of the heap.
- View the file system within your app's sandbox.
- Explore all classes in your app and linked systems frameworks (public and private).
- Quickly access useful objects such as `[UIApplication sharedApplication]`, the app delegate, the root view controller on the key window, and more.
- Dynamically view and modify `NSUserDefaults` values.

Unlike many other debugging tools, FLEX runs entirely inside your app, so you don't need to be connected to LLDB/Xcode or a different remote debugging server. It works well in the simulator and on physical devices.


## Usage
Short version:

```objc
[[FLEXManager sharedManager] showExplorer];
```

More complete version:

```objc
#if DEBUG
#import "FLEXManager.h"
#endif

...

- (void)handleSixFingerQuadrupleTap:(UITapGestureRecognizer *)tapRecognizer
{
#if DEBUG
    if (tapRecognizer.state == UIGestureRecognizerStateRecognized) {
        // This could also live in a handler for a keyboard shortcut, debug menu item, etc.
        [[FLEXManager sharedManager] showExplorer];
    }
#endif
}
```


## Feature Examples
### Modify Views
Once a view is selected, you can tap on the info bar below the toolbar to present more details about the view. From there, you can modify properties and call methods.

### All Objects on the Heap
FLEX queries malloc for all the live allocated memory blocks and searches for ones that look like objects. You can see everything from here.

### File Browser
View the file system within your app's sandbox. FLEX shows file sizes, image previews, and pretty prints `.json` and `.plist` files. You can copy text and image files to the pasteboard if you want to inspect them outside of your app.

### System Library Exploration
Go digging for all things public and private. To learn more about a class, you can create an instance of it and explore its default state.

### NSUserDefaults Editing
FLEX allows you to edit defaults that are any combination of strings, numbers, arrays, and dictionaries. The input is parsed as `JSON`. If other kinds of objects are set for a defaults key (i.e. `NSDate`), you can view them but not edit them.

### Learning from Other Apps
The code injection is left as an exercise for the reader. :innocent:

## Excluding FLEX from Release (App Store) Builds
FLEX makes it easy to explore the internals of your app, so it is not something you should expose to your users. Fortunately, it is easy to exclude FLEX files from Release builds. In Xcode, navigate to the "Build Settings" tab of your project. Click the plus and select `Add User-Defined Setting`.

![Add User-Defined Setting](http://engineering.flipboard.com/assets/flex/flex-readme-exclude-1.png)

Name the setting `EXCLUDED_SOURCE_FILE_NAMES`. For your `Release` configuration, set the value to `FLEX*`. This will exclude all files with the prefix FLEX from compilation. Leave the value blank for your `Debug` configuration.

![EXCLUDED_SOURCE_FILE_NAMES](http://engineering.flipboard.com/assets/flex/flex-readme-exclude-2.png)

At the places in your code where you integrate FLEX, do a `#if DEBUG` check to ensure the tool is only accessible in your `Debug` builds and to avoid errors in your `Release` builds. For more help with integrating FLEX, see the example project.


## Additional Notes
- When setting fields of type `id` or values in `NSUserDefaults`, FLEX attempts to parse the input string as `JSON`. This allows you to use a combination of strings, numbers, arrays, and dictionaries. If you want to set a string value, it must be wrapped in quotes. For ivars or properties that are explicitly typed as `NSStrings`, quotes are not required.
- You may want to disable the exception breakpoint while using FLEX. Certain functions that FLEX uses throw exceptions when they get input they can't handle (i.e. `NSGetSizeAndAlignment()`). FLEX catches these to avoid crashing, but your breakpoint will get hit if it is active.
